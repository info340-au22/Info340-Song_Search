            For some people, it is quite difficult to find songs similar to ones they like. Some people might want to filter songs that are explicit, or find songs in the same album or by the same artist that they like. Using our music-finding app, people can find songs to add to their playlists just by inputting a few fields. Also, rising artists that want to promote their content for no cost could use our platform to help people find their songs and grow in popularity. Since there are so many songs that have already been made along with more constantly being made, it can be difficult for music listeners to find new songs that they like. This makes it very hard for new artists to find a platform to reach new users who have interest in their song genres. There currently is not a great way to connect new artists to audiences that are currently looking for new and fresh music that they haven't heard before. This creates a technological problem for both artists and listeners, as new songs are constantly being made that never have the footing to reach curious listeners. YouTube and Spotify give suggested playlists based on the songs you listen to, but they aren’t typically specific, such as specifically looking at the genre and the artist. Also, the algorithms behind the two platforms aren't necessarily helpful to new artists and they won’t get promoted easily. TikTok’s algorithm is extremely random, and artists shouldn’t be essentially gambling for success.
