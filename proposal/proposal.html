            <h3>Problem Description</h3>
            <p>
                For some people, it is quite difficult to find songs similar to ones they like. Some people might want to filter songs that are explicit, or find songs in the same album or by the same artist that they like. Using our music-finding app, people can find songs to add to their playlists just by inputting a few fields. Also, rising artists that want to promote their content for no cost could use our platform to help people find their songs and grow in popularity. Since there are so many songs that have already been made along with more constantly being made, it can be difficult for music listeners to find new songs that they like. This makes it very hard for new artists to find a platform to reach new users who have interest in their song genres. There currently is not a great way to connect new artists to audiences that are currently looking for new and fresh music that they haven't heard before. This creates a technological problem for both artists and listeners, as new songs are constantly being made that never have the footing to reach curious listeners. YouTube and Spotify give suggested playlists based on the songs you listen to, but they aren’t typically specific, such as specifically looking at the genre and the artist. Also, <a href="https://www.eliftech.com/insights/all-you-need-to-know-about-a-music-recommendation-system-with-a-step-by-step-guide-to-creating-it/">the algorithms</a> behind the two platforms as well as many others aren't necessarily helpful to new artists and they won’t get promoted easily. TikTok’s algorithm is extremely random, and artists shouldn’t be essentially gambling for success.

                <h3>Proposed Application</h3>
            <p>The users of this application will be mainly people who are looking for new songs to their playlist that are also similar to what they are currently listening to. 
                People who may be unfamiliar with a certain genre of music can easily find new songs to listen to within this category of interest. In addition, small artists will 
                be able to add and promote their own music on this webpage in order to gain popularity more easily. Additionally, artists who may not have the funds or popularity on 
                social media to promote their music will now be able to ease and for free. Users will be able to use this web app to search for recommended songs based on the genres, 
                artists, and song length that they prefer. This will also let them sort by various features such as energy, explicitness, as well as the songs rated danceability so that 
                they can find a list of tracks that meet their preferences. This app will also benefit new artists, as they will be able to upload their new songs and tag them by the 
                genre and metrics they believe best fits. Users will be able to sort for newly released songs, giving artists a platform to reach this new audience. This app will focus 
                on sorting and filtering data, where the user will input their own information that they want to be stored. At the moment, we plan on starting our music database using a 
                Kaggle dataset collected through <a href=" https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks?select=tracks.csv">Spotify’s API here.</a> On this app, music 
                listeners will be able to find songs from new artists within a chosen genre more easily. Songs that have already been made on top of songs being currently released by 
                already popular artists have clouded many song finding algorithms and so we strive to change this. With new artists being able to upload their own music to the webpage, 
                they are able to promote their music much more easily without being popular on social media platforms.
            </p>
